# Modeling and Formal Verification of Truck Platooning System

The operation of a group of vehicles at small inter-vehicular distances, known as vehicle platooning, lowers the overall aerodynamic drag and, therefore, reduces fuel consumption
and greenhouse gas emissions. In this project we studied, modeled, and formally verified a truck platooning system operating on a straight patch of highway road. We showed our 
model for the follower vehicle in a two-vehicle highway platoon which maintains a constant safe distance from the lead vehicle and we also incorporate communication delay 
between the lead vehicle and the control decision taken by the follower vehicle. We then extend our model to a three-vehicle platoon with two follower vehicles and one lead 
vehicle.
